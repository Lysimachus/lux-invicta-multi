fixed:
music pack .txts had songname instead of song_name, replaced songname with song_name
many old triggered modifiers in event_modifiers/former_triggered_modifiers used ai_ambition, commented this out
difficulty levels in static_modifiers.txt had naval_morale which doesn't exist, removed
base_values in static_modifiers.txt had naval_organization, removed
tribal_invasion in cb_invasions allowed Aztecs to use it but requires a realm size of greater than one to be valid 
	so the sunset invasion would constantly declare wars and then instantly have those wars be invalid, commented out is_valid contents
